# Discordbar

Fixes some issues I have with Discord's UI and introduces a much improved immersive titlebar

## Features

- Immersive titlebar
- Theme compatibility (As long as you just edit Discord's CSS variables)

## Installation

Add the following URL as a remote theme:

```url
https://reabstraction.github.io/Discordbar/general.css
```
